# Csharp-Calculator
Calculator that takes in a number followed by an operator. 

It currently takes in as many numbers and operators - back and forth between them, number first and last - and then finishes on an equals.
I don't currently know the best way to check if the value is either an integer or an operator, so there's no catch for invalid input yet.
Also need to figure out how to allow decimals after division. Right now it's only integers, which is fine for the simple version, but obviously isn't ideal.
